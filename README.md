Our app helps keep people safe by sending real-time alerts about police reports, accidents, and other incidents happening nearby. Users can set a custom radius to track events in their area and get instant notifications to stay informed. The app gathers data from official sources, user reports, and smart analysis to provide accurate updates. It also includes features to quickly contact emergency services or trusted contacts when needed. With a focus on privacy and security, the app creates a community-driven way to help people stay aware, avoid danger, and feel more confident wherever they go.
